## FlyballETS-Housing

The FlyballETS-Housing project is a subproject of the [Flyball ETS project](https://sparkydevices.wordpress.com/tag/flyball-ets/).
It contains the design files which can be used to build the housing required for the Flyball ETS system.

## Design Files

The design files are in SketchUp format, and consist of 2 files:
* FlyballETS-Active.skp: The design file for the active side of the flyball ETS gates.
* FlyballETS-Passive.skp: The design file for the passive side of the flyball ETS gates.
* Foot/skp: The design file for the foot which supports both sides of the gates.

These files can be used by people who want to improve or change the design.

## Export Files

I have also provided 3 sets of export files, one for each side of the gates, and one set for the foot, which are made up out of PNG images which show all necessary views of the design, with measurements attached where applicalbe. These files can be used by builders who just want to build the housing for this project.
